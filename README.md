# Network-Management-System-with-Angular
Network Management System with using Angular, Python and SQL. I worked on this project for my internship. 

## Usage
Users can create devices, connect them to each other, give them some information and watch their change real time with graphs.

## Used Technologies
- Angular.js, D3.js, Leaflet.js, Bootstrap, Rxjs for frontend. Jasmine and Karma for testing.
- Python, FastAPI, SQLite for backend.

## Features
### - Network Simulation
Currently system doesnt have access to real devices instead it uses virtual devices created for this system. It enables random status for devices and connections every 5-10 second like system fails etc. If i find some time i can try to implement Mininet.

### - Authentication System with Python Backend
Users can register or login to system with authentication handled in backend. Passwords are stored hashed.
